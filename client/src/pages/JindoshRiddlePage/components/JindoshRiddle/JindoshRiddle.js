          <p>At the dinner party were Lady Winslow, Doctor Marcolla, Countess</p>
          <p>Contee, Madam Natsiou, and Baroness Finch.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>The women sat in a row. They all wore different colors and ???</p>
          <p>wore a jaunty ??? hat. ??? was at the far left, next to the</p>
          <p>guest wearing a ??? jacket. The lady in ??? sat left of someone in ???. I</p>
          <p>remember that ??? outfit because the woman spilled her ??? all over</p>
          <p>it. The traveler from ??? was dressed entirely in ???. When one of</p>
          <p>the dinner guests bragged about her ???, the woman next to her said</p>
          <p>they were finer in ???, where she lived.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>So ??? showed off a prized ???, at which the lady</p>
          <p>from ??? scoffed, saying it was no match for her ???. Someone else</p>
          <p>carried a valuable ??? and when she saw it, the visitor from</p>
          <p>??? next to her almost spilled her neighbor's ???. ???</p>
          <p>raised her ??? in toast. The lady from ???, full of ???, jumped up</p>
          <p>onto the table, falling onto the guest in the center seat, spilling the poor</p>
          <p>woman's ???. Then ??? captivated them all with a wild story</p>
          <p>about her wild youth in ???</p>
          <br />
          <p>In the morning, there were four heirlooms under the table: the ???,</p>
          <p>???, the ???, and the ???.</p>
          <br />
          <p>But who owned each?</p>
